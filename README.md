FormShare 2.0
=========
The future of FormHub

Centralize data â€“ Decentralize knowledge

About
-----
FormShare 2.0 is inspired from the excellent [Formhub](<http://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub>) platform developed by the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. After I forked OnaData back in 2016 it was clear that the code needed at lot to bring it to the ideas that I had, for example: Integrate it with [ODK Tools](https://github.com/qlands/odktools) and provide a proper MySQL repository to centralize the data while using latest software technologies to decentralize the management.

FormShare 2.0 has been written from scratch using Python 3, [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) and [PyUtilib](https://github.com/PyUtilib/pyutilib) to deliver a complete data management solution for ODK Data collection

FormShare 2.0 was created because:

* I want to provide a open source **free** platform to private and public organizations to help them manage their data when using ODK.
* ODK Aggregate, in my personal opinion, is badly designed, buggy and not interoperable. ODK Central is just not there yet.
* Ona, KoBoToolbox and the rest since are based on Formhub are not good enough when dealing with things like data cleaning, auditing, sensitivity, integrity and interoperability.

FormShare 2.0 **is for organizations** to install it in their own server or cloud service to serve ODK XForms and collect and manage the submissions. FormShare 2.0 is also available as as service at https://formshare.qlands.com

More to come....
