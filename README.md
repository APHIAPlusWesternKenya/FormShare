FormShare 2.0
=========
The future of FormHub

Centralize data â€“ Decentralize knowledge

About
-----
FormShare 2.0 is inspired from the excellent [FormHub](<http://github.com/SEL-Columbia/formhub>) platform developed by the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. After I forked [OnaData](https://github.com/onaio/onadata) (a fork of FormHub) back in 2016 it was clear that the code needed at lot to bring it to the main ideas that I had: 1) Integrate it with [ODK Tools](https://github.com/qlands/odktools), 2) provide a proper MySQL repository to centralize the data and, 3) use latest software technologies to decentralize the management.

FormShare 2.0 was created because:

* I want to provide a open source **free** platform to private and public organizations to help them manage their data when using ODK.
* ODK Aggregate, in my personal opinion, is badly designed, buggy and not interoperable. ODK Central is just not there yet.
* Forks based on FormHub suffer from the same ills of their father: Django (sorry if I hurt your feelings), no proper repository, rudimentary data cleaning, no auditing, little interoperability, poor or none extensibility... among many others.

FormShare 2.0 has been written from scratch (not a single line of code comes from Formhub, just ideas and principles) using Python 3, [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) and [PyUtilib](https://github.com/PyUtilib/pyutilib) to deliver a complete and extensible data management solution for ODK Data collection. It took us three years but is finally here :-) and it is Django free!

FormShare **is for organizations** to install it in their own server or cloud service to serve ODK XForms and collect and manage the submissions. FormShare is also available as as service at https://formshare.qlands.com for those organizations that lacks the capacity or resources to run their own installation.

Releases
------------
The current stable release is 2.0.0 and it is available [here](https://github.com/qlands/FormShare/tree/stable-2.0) 

Installation
------------
Please read the [Installation guide](install_steps.txt) if you want to install FormShare manually. However, we encourage you to use the Docker Compose file available in the docker_compose directory.


Contributing
------------

The best way to contribute to FormShare is by testing it and posting issues. If you can fix things do the following:

1. Fork FormShare
2. Clone your fork in your local computer
3. Create a branch for your fix **based on the master branch**
4. Create the fix, commit and code an push that branch to your forked repository
5. Crate a pull request

We also appreciate and need translation files. See the Localization section.

Customization and Extension
------------
FormShare uses [PyUtilib Component Architecture](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.616.8737&rep=rep1&type=pdf) to allow customization and extension. The best way to do it is by using the [FormShare Plugin CookieCutter](https://github.com/qlands/formshare-cookiecutter-plugin) and explore the different Interfaces.

What can you do through extension plug-ins? Some ideas:

- Integrate the FormShare login with your company Windows Authentication.
- Change the colors, logos and all aspects of the user interface.
- Integrate messaging services like WhatsApp to inform field agents when a new version of a form is up.
- Collect data using USSD or IVR services with the same ODK form and store the data in the same repository no matter the source.
- Implement longitudinal surveys where the data of a form is pulled to populate the options of another form.

You basically can extend FormShare to fit your need. We are working on proper documentation for this.


Localization
------------

FormShare comes out of the box in English, Spanish and French (Google generated). It uses Babel for translation and you can help us by creating new translations or by correcting an existing one.

To generate a new translation:


    $ cd formshare
    $ python setup.py init_catalog -l [new_language_ISO_639-1_code]
    $ python setup.py extract_messages
    $ python setup.py update_catalog

The translation files (.po) are available at formshare/locale/[language-code]/LC_MESSAGES. You can edit a .po file with tools like [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/download), [Lokalize](https://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize), [GTranslator](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtranslator) or a simple text editor. Once the translation is done you can send us the updated or new .po file as an issue and we will add it to FormShare.
